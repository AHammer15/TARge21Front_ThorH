    <h1>The story in the book</h1>
    <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
    <p>
        I kneeled there, covered in blood, both my own, and someone else's. The book <i>A New Front</i> lay 
        there as well, painted crimson. I remembered a quote from said book: <q>In war, blood is inevitable</q>, 
        how fitting. The <abbr title="Armored Personnel Carrier">APC</abbr> was wrecked, no salvaging that.
